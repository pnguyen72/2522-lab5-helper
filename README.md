# COMP 2522 Lab 5 Helper

Who has the time to manually create 91 authors and 100 books? Not me.

Usage:

1. Create a local MySQL database.

2. In the terminal (not in MySQL), run

```sh
mysql -u [user-name] [db-name] -p < 2522lab5.sql
# for example,
# mysql -u root 2522lab5 -p < 2522lab5.sql
```

3. Add the library `mysql-connector-j-9.2.0` to your project via IntelliJ.

4. Add `Database.java` to your project. Add the package declaration and/or edit the imports if necessary to match how you structure your project. See the javadoc for usage.
